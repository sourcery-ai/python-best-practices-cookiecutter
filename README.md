Most of the setup steps are automated, but one can also follow a flow similar to the below.

```sh
# Install pipx if pipenv and cookiecutter are not installed
python3 -m pip install pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath

# Install pipenv using pipx
pipx install pipenv

# Use cookiecutter to create project from this template
pipx run cookiecutter gh:jevandezande/python-best-practices-cookiecutter
```


The cookiecutter will auotmatically
- Enter project directory
- Initialise git repo
- Install dependencies
